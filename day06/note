So, suppose you have a lanternfish with an internal timer value of 3:

- After one day, its internal timer would become 2.
- After another day, its internal timer would become 1.
- After another day, its internal timer would become 0.

- After another day, its internal timer would reset to 6, and it would create a
  new lanternfish with an internal timer of 8.

- After another day, the first lanternfish would have an internal timer of 5, and
  the second lanternfish would have an internal timer of 7.


A lanternfish that creates a new fish resets its timer to 6, not 7 (because 0
is included as a valid timer value). The new lanternfish starts with an
internal timer of 8 and does not start counting down until the next day.
