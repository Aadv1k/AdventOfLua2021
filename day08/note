from 8 we can deduce
8: abcdefg
    3: acdfg
    2: acdeg
    5: abdfg


(acd)
3 must contain f,g
2 must contain e,g

5 starts with abd

abc
efg
bcdef

does not contain agc
cdfbe

6
if we put 1 (2) over 6 there should only be 1 overlap 

if we put 4 (4) over 0, there should only be 4 overlaps

if it does not fit these criterion, its 9

---- 

5
if we put 1 (2) over 3 there should be 2 overlaps 

if we put 1 (2) over 2 then there should be 1 overlap

    
else its 5
